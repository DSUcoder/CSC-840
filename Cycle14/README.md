# Cycle 14 - Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)

## Executive Summary
This cycle is a quick overview of EMET.  A PDF presentation is provided with details.  A video demonstration is given to show how EMET works to make exploitation more difficult.

## Content
* PDF Presentation
  * Provides a detailed walkthrough of EMET

## Why Am I Interested?
* I am more experienced with Linux than Windows, so I was not familiar with EMET until I took Dr. DeMott's Advanced Software Exploitation course.  Now that I know EMET exists, I believe that every cyber security researcher should be aware of EMET's capabilities.  EMET makes software exploitation more difficult by implementing several advanced mitigations.  This cycle demonstrates how EMET works.

## Future Work
Future work could include:
- Memory leakage attacks 
- How grsecurity can provide similar protection for Linux
